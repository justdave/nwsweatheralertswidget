<a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>This is an Android home screen widget to display current weather alerts from the US National Weather Service.</p>

<p>You can choose a county or state within the US (or the entire US) and it will display a list of all of the current weather alerts for that area on the widget.  If there's more than fits, the list scrolls, and you can tap on an alert to open the full text of the alert in your web browser.  There is an accompanying app which can be used to configure what area you want and shows the raw feed data if you're really curious (though that part was mostly there for debugging, and might go away one of these days now that it all works)</p>

<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>I created this because I wanted a tablet on the wall in my kitchen to display weather alerts on the screen, and for all the plethora of weather apps out there, I couldn't find one that showed anything more than a (!) icon on their widgets for alerts, and you had to click through to find out what they were. Some of them would put the alerts into the notification bar, but that wasn't much better. So this one displays a list of the current alerts right on the widget, and that is the only purpose of the widget.</p>
