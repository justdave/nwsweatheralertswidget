# Privacy Policy for NWS Weather Alerts Widget

**Last Updated: 2025-12-13**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the NWS Weather Alerts Widget for Android.

**Information We Collect and Use**

To provide weather alerts for your chosen location, the app sends your selected county or zone ID directly to the US National Weather Service (NWS) API. This is required to retrieve relevant alert information. Your device's IP address may also be visible to the NWS as part of this standard internet communication.

We do **not** collect, log, store, or transmit any other personally identifiable information about you. All other data, including your widget configurations, is stored locally on your device and is never sent to our servers.

**Permissions**

The app requires the following permissions to function:

*   **Internet**: To download weather alert data from the NWS.
*   **Foreground Service**: To keep the alert checking service running in the background so your widgets stay up to date.
*   **Post Notifications**: To display the persistent notification required for the background service to run.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
